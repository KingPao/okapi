    <desc>
        <p>This method allows you to change properties of an existing log entry
        image. If you need to change the image itself, then you'll need to
        delete it and re-add it.</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='image_uuid'>
        <p>ID of the log entry image to be edited. The user of your Access
        Token must be the author of the associated log entry.</p>
    </req>
    <opt name='caption'>
        <p>Default value: <b>(empty string)</b></p>
        <p>Plain-text string, a new caption for the image. If the string is
        empty, the caption of the image will not be changed.</p>
    </opt>
    <opt name='is_spoiler' default='null'>
        <p>One of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>true</b> - add the spoiler flag to the image, which
                indicates that the image contains hints for finding the
                geocache.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>false</b> - remove the spoiler flag of the image.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>null</b> - do not change the spoiler flag.

    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p><b>saved_caption</b> - the actual value of the caption that
                was saved. Please note, that this may differ from the
                <b>new_caption</b> you have provided. This field will be
                present only when you were attempting to change the
                caption.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Please note, that you can receive an empty JSON object too (when
        you're changing <b>is_spoiler</b> flag only).</p>
