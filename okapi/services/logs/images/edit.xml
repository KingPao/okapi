    <brief>Edit an existing log entry image</brief>
    <issue-id>WRTODO</issue-id>
    <desc>
        <p>This method allows you to change properties of an existing log entry
        image. If you need to change the image itself, then you'll need to
        delete it and re-add it.</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='image_uuid'>
        <p>ID of the log entry image to be edited. The user of your Access
        Token must be the author of the associated log entry.</p>
    </req>
    <opt name='caption'>
        <p>Plain-text string, a new caption for the image.</p>

        <p>If you don't want to to change the caption, then don't use this
        parameter in your request. Please note, that providing an empty value
        still counts as "using it" (and it indicates that your user would like
        the caption removed, which will often not be allowed).</p>
    </opt>
    <opt name='is_spoiler' default='null'>
        <p>One of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>true</b> - add the spoiler flag to the image, which
                indicates that the image contains hints for finding the
                geocache.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>false</b> - remove the spoiler flag of the image.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>null</b> - do not change the spoiler flag.
            </li>
         </ul>
    </opt>

    <returns>
        <p>A dictionary of the following structure:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><b>success</b> - <b>true</b>, if the image was edited successfully,</li>
            <li>
                <b>message</b> - plain-text string, a message for the user,
                which acknowledges success or describes an error (usually you
                want to display this only when <b>success</b> is <b>false</b>).
            </li>
        </ul>
    </returns>
