        <p>This method allows you to change properties of an existing log entry
        image. If you need to change the image itself, then you'll need to
        delete it and re-add it.</p>
        <p>At least one of the three parameters <b>caption</b>,
        <b>is_spoiler</b> and <b>position</b> must be supplied.</p>
    </desc>
    <req name='image_uuid'>
        <p>ID of the log entry image to be edited. The user of your Access
        Token must be the author of the associated log entry.</p>
    </req>
    <opt name='caption'>
        <p>Plain-text string, a new caption for the image.</p>

        <p>Please note that providing an empty value indicates that your user
        would like to remove the caption, which will often not be allowed
        (then <b>success</b> will be <b>false</b>).</p>
    </opt>
    <opt name='is_spoiler'>
        <p>One of the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <b>true</b> - marks the image as spoiler, which means that
                it contains hints for finding the geocache.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>false</b> - marks the image as non-spoiler.
            </li>
         </ul>

            <li>
                <b>message</b> - plain-text string, a message for the user,
                which acknowledges success or describes an error (usually you
                want to display this only when <b>success</b> is <b>false</b>),
            </li>
            <li>
                <b>position</b> - 0-based position of the image on the
                log entry's list of images (changed or unchanged), if the
                <b>position</b> option was supplied. <b>null</b>, if the
                <b>position</b> option was omitted or in case of an error.
            </li>
        </ul>
